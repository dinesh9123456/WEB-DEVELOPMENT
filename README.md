# WEB-DEVELOPMENT

**Task 1: Basics of Web Development**

- **Objective:** Learn and apply foundational concepts of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Description:**

  - Build a simple webpage using these elements.
  - Apply basic CSS to style the webpage, adding colors, fonts, spacing, and layout adjustments.
  - Introduce simple JavaScript to create basic interactivity, such as responding to button clicks or displaying alerts[1].

**Task 2: Intermediate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**

- **Objective:** Enhance HTML and CSS skills; learn JavaScript for DOM manipulation.
- **Description:** 
  - Create and style a form with various input types (text, email, submit).
  - Implement JavaScript form validation to check for required fields and correct email format.
  - Learn responsive design by building layouts using Flexbox for navigation and CSS Grid for content areas, and apply media queries for adaptability across devices.
  - Develop a dynamic to-do list or image gallery using JavaScript, allowing users to add and remove items dynamically[1].

**Task 3: Advanced Styling and JavaScript**

- **Objective:** Gain advanced skills in CSS and JavaScript for interactive, responsive sites.
- **Description:** 
  - Use advanced CSS media queries to adjust layouts, font sizes, and other elements for different devices.
  - Build more complex JavaScript projects, such as an interactive quiz with multiple questions or an image carousel that reacts to user interaction.
  - Learn how to fetch and display real-time data from external APIs using JavaScript[1].

**Task 4: Full Project Implementation**

- **Objective:** Combine HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build fully functioning projects.
- **Description:** 
  - Design and build a responsive portfolio website with sections like "About," "Projects," and "Contact."
  - Enhance a to-do list or note-taking app by implementing local storage, so tasks or notes persist between sessions.
  - Create interactive product pages where users can filter and sort items based on categories, price, or rating[1].

**Task 5: Final Project and Optimization**

- **Objective:** Build a comprehensive web app and ensure its performance, responsiveness, and compatibility.
- **Description:** 
  - Integrate all learned skills into a capstone project, such as an e-commerce site, blog, or advanced portfolio, featuring dynamic and interactive elements.
  - Test the project across major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and mobile devices, fixing compatibility or display issues.
  - Optimize the application for performance by minimizing CSS and JavaScript files, applying lazy loading for images, reducing HTTP requests, and ensuring fast load times[1].
